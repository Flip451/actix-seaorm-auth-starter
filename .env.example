# Number of events processed per relay batch.
# - Lower values (e.g. 5–20) are suitable for development or low-traffic setups.
# - Higher values (e.g. 50–500) can improve throughput in production, but increase memory usage.

# Interval, in seconds, between relay batch processing runs.
# - Use a small interval (e.g. 1–5) for near real-time processing.
# - Use a larger interval (e.g. 10–60+) to reduce database load at the cost of higher latency.
