# Number of events processed per relay batch.
# - Lower values (e.g. 5–20) are suitable for development or low-traffic setups.
# - Higher values (e.g. 50–500) can improve throughput in production, but increase memory usage.
RELAY_BATCH_SIZE=10

# Interval, in seconds, between relay batch processing runs.
# - Use a small interval (e.g. 1–5) for near real-time processing.
# - Use a larger interval (e.g. 10–60+) to reduce database load at the cost of higher latency.
RELAY_INTERVAL_SECS=5

# Maximum number of retry attempts for failed event deliveries.
# - A value of 0 means no retries.
# - Higher values (e.g. 3–10) increase the chances of eventual delivery.
RELAY_MAX_RETRIES=5

# Base delay, in seconds, before the first retry attempt.
# - A small delay (e.g. 1–5) allows for quick retries.
# - Larger delays (e.g. 10+) can help avoid overwhelming the target service.
RELAY_BACKOFF_BASE_DELAY_SECONDS=5

# Multiplier for exponential backoff on retries.
# - A value of 2 doubles the delay with each retry.
# - Higher values (e.g. 3–5) increase the delay more rapidly.
RELAY_BACKOFF_BASE_FACTOR=2

# Maximum backoff factor, to cap the delay between retries.
# - This prevents excessively long delays.
# - Set to a reasonable value (e.g. RELAY_BACKOFF_BASE_DELAY_SECONDS * RELAY_BACKOFF_MAX_FACTOR ~ 30–120 seconds) based on your application's tolerance for delay.
RELAY_BACKOFF_MAX_FACTOR=60

# Maximum jitter in milliseconds to add randomness to backoff delays.
# - This helps prevent thundering herd problems when many events are retried simultaneously.
# - A value of 0 means no jitter.
# - Typical values range from 100 to 1000 milliseconds.
RELAY_BACKOFF_JITTER_MAX_MILLIS=1000
